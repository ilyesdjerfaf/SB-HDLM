# SB-HDLM : Sentiment Based Hybrid Deep Learning Models

## Abstract :
This project proposes item recommendation approach based on deep learning and sentiment analysis techniques. Our approach entitled SB-HDLM (Sentiment Based – Hybrid Deep Learning Models), combines user- ratings with scores predicted by sentiment analysis, where two variations of the hybrid deep learning models have been used CNN-LSTM and RNN-LSTM, with two different word embeddings Word2Vev and Glove. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two e-commerce datasets, “Amazon Movies and TV” and “Amazon Video Games” showed that GloVe generated better performance compared to Word2Vec and that the RNN-LSTM model outperformed the CNN-LSTM model. Moreover, our model surpassed several existing models in terms of **MAE and RMSE** evaluation metrics.
